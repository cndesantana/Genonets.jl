# Genonets.jl
This is a Julia implementaion of the [Python package Genonet](https://github.com/fkhalid/genonets), used as background of [Genonets Server](http://ieu-genonets.uzh.ch/) for creating and analyzing genotype networks from raw data. The library is under development, but we hope to provide documentation as soon as we have the main functionality implemented.
